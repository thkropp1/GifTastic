# GifTastic

I used the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of the user's choice. The app calls the GIPHY API and uses JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the site.

Instructions:

When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

When the user clicks on one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user clicks on the gif again, it stops playing.
Under every gif displays its rating (PG, G, so on).

This data is provided by the GIPHY API.

#3. Error checking: Leave the input field blank and click on Submit. Get an alert message: Please enter a name.
